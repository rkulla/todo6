# todo6

Todo6 is an app I created after a long time spent writing to-do lists that
contained more than 6 items.

Q: Why limit yourself to 6 items?
A: First of all, this is a 'main' todo list. It's not necessarily the only
   list you'll make in a given day. For example, my main todo list in todo6
   might contain "shopping" but actual shopping list (bananas, eggs, OJ) 
   would be in a separate list on my iPhone, for example. I also like to
   make separate "focus" lists in a productivity app such as a "Pomodoro"
   app where my todo6 list might say "Read chapter 5 of Programming Python"
   and my pomodoro list would have focused task items such as "Do exercise 1",
   "Do exercise 2", etc.

   I believe in the "don't put more than 6 items on a todo list" philosophy 
   because it rarely did I accomplish more than 6 macro tasks at a time. If
   I do complete all 6, then great. I can then start another list -- even
   if it's in the same day -- and feel a lot more accomplished than 
   completing "only" 6 things on a 20 line list.

Q: Why do I have to input tasks in a separate text file instead of in
   the app directly?
A: This is mainly because the app keeps everything in memory so if you
   close the app it would be gone - and if "rebooting" was on your todo
   list, you could do so without losing your todo list for the day. And
   since it only holds 6 items at a time, a real database feels overkill.
   I also prefer being able to use a real text editor for adding tasks.
   And keeping it in a separate file allows you to easily print it, or
   move it to a shared/cloud folder for access on other devices, etc.

Q: Why an app at all - isn't the text file enough?
A: Sure. But I wanted something that would force me to only put 6 items
   in my lists at a time. The app won't even allow you to add new items
   from inside it. Instead you have to go to edit the text file and 
   rerun the app, and if the file contains more than 6 things it won't 
   open.

Q: Why a command-line todo app?

A: Because I don't like my GUI todo apps that show up everytime I'm
alternating windows with Alt+Tab. I prefer to keep todo6 running in a
screen or tmux window, out of my way.

## Usage

Create a file in your home directory called todo6.txt and put one task
per line. (create no more than 6 lines!)

Then, assuming you got this todo6 as a jar file, run the todo6 app with:

    $ java -jar todo6.jar

If you just have the source code and have leiningen:

    $ lein trampoline run
