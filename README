# todo6

Todo6 is an app I created after a long time spent writing to-do lists that
contained more than 6 items.

I believe in the "don't put more than 6 items on a todo list" philosophy 
because it rarely did I accomplish more than 6 things at a time. And if
I do complete all 6, then great. I can then start another list -- even
if it's in the same day -- and feel a lot more accomplished than 
completing "only" 6 things on a 20 line list.

And because the list is so small, it's very easy to not bother storing
it in a database anything. It's small enough to remember.


Q: Why an app at all - isn't the text file enough?
A: Sure. But I wanted something that would force me to only put 6 items
   in my lists at a time.

Q: Why a command-line todo app?

A: Because I don't like my GUI todo apps that show up everytime I'm
alternating windows with Alt+Tab. I prefer to keep todo6 running in a
screen or tmux window, out of my way.

## Usage

Create a file in your home directory called todo6.txt and put one task
per line. (create no more than 6 lines!)

Then, assuming you got this todo6 as a jar file, run the todo6 app with:

    $ java -jar todo6.jar

If you just have the source code and have leiningen:

    $ lein trampoline run
